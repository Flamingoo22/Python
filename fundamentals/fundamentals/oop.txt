Obejct Oriented Programming
Object
Properties = Attributes
Behavior = methods

class user:
    attributes:   //what does user have
        first_name:
        last_name:
        age:
    Methods:       //what does user do
        birthday()  #increase age
        say_greeting()  #say hello

Class is the blueprints

class create instances/objects

attributes and methods are default public, but we can set them private and protected
Private doesn't share with instance and inheritances
Protected can be share with inheritances

constructor is used to share attributes/methods

Inheritance

Protected


Attributes: Characteristics shared by all instances of the class type.
Methods: Actions that an object can perform. A user in a banking application, for example, may need to be able to calculate age based on the user's birthday or open a new bank account associated with that user.
