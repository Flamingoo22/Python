Obejct Oriented Programming
Object
Properties = Attributes
Behavior = methods

class user:
    attributes:   //what does user have
        first_name:
        last_name:
        age:
    Methods:       //what does user do
        birthday()          #increase age
        say_greeting()      #say hello

Class is the blueprints

class create instances/objects

attributes and methods are default public, but we can set them private and protected
Private doesn't share with instance and inheritances
Protected can be share with inheritances

constructor is used to share attributes/methods

Inheritance

Protected


Attributes: Characteristics shared by all instances of the class type.
Methods: Actions that an object can perform. A user in a banking application, for example, may need to be able to calculate age based on the user's birthday or open a new bank account associated with that user.

4 pillars of OOP
    Encapsulation: we can set attributes and methods as public or private
    Inheritance: we can share the attributes and methods with children class by using keyword: super()
    Polymorphism: many forms, meaning children classes can inheriance the parent methods, but when reassigned in children class, the method can be override
    Abstraction: use the method build from another class without coding out all the previous attributes



OOP -- The four pillars

Encapsulation---
    group code together into these entities we call classes

Inheritance
    Ability to create subclasses that have all the attributes and methods of the parent class






Package + Modules
Modules are just .py files that hold functionality -- they might be made up of functions, classes, variable, etc
Package -- are directories that hold multiple modules
