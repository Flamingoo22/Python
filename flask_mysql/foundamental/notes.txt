mysqlconnect.py 
    contains a class from which we can build an object that represent a pre-build database
    and help us create a database connection and run queries
The query_db() method may return 
    a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represent a row in the table
The query_db() method returns 
    the row id
        when we run an insert query
The main reason to sanitize our data is to (USE prepared-statemtns)
    prevent SQL injection
The query_db method returns 
    Nothing
        When we delete or update query
The query_db will return 
    False 
        if our query does not executed correctly
