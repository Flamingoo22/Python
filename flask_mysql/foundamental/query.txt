PREPARED STATEMENT
query = 'UPDATE friends SET first_name = %(fn)s  WHERE id=%(id_num)s;'
data = {
    'fn': //possibily a value from a from,
    'id_num': //possibily a value from the url,
}
mysql.query_db (query, data)

connection to db - mysql - the instance of MySQLConnection class
query string - 'INSERT INTO...' - the string that will eventually be executed on our MySQL server
data dictionary - the values that will be interpolated into the query string
data dictionary keys - fn, id_num - the keys of the data dictionary used in query
    (i.e. %(key_name)s)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %(email)s;"
    
# the placeholder variable is called email
# it must match the key name in the data dictionary
data = { 
    # this 'email' Key in data must be named to match the placeholder in the query.
    'email' : request.form['email'] 
}
result = mysql.query_db(query, data)




String Interpolation
# this code is for demonstration purposes only
# DO NOT use this code in production, it will leave you vulnerable to SQL injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{request.form['email']}';"
result = mysql.query_db(query)

    using string interpolation will open out possibily for SQL injection
        meaning people with SQL knowledge will be able to hack into our data base and retreive or change the data
