hashing
    one-way   
    irreversible


encryption
    two ways
    reversible
        needs the key to access info
        good for bank info and private text


1. Store sensitive info directly to database
    WORST IDEA 
        easily hacked
2. Hash the password
    Better, not good enough
        computer generate random strings dedicated for each password and store them in database instead of the password itself
            each password combination has its unique hash
                Still easily hackable given the technology
3. Add the "salt" to the password and hash it
    Better than better, but still can be better
        hash is determined by length of original password, adding the salt would increase the length of password and the hash will be more complex
            Still hackable if hacker get into your database and retrieve our "salt"
4. Add unique 'salt' to each user password
    Best we have got, the point is not to worry hacker get the salt, but to add another test subject to slow down hacker from getting each user password
        Still hackable, just slower

5.Brypt / not the best hashing algorithum, but slowest. User cannot notice the differences, but would slow down hacker's process.
