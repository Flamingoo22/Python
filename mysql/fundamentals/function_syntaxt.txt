SELECT CONCAT(name_column, any string) FROM name_table

    concat_ws() applies separation to each value

return the number of characters

LOWER(name_column) FROM name_table
return the string in lowercase

HOUR(name_column with DATATYPE == DATETIME) FROM name_table
return the number of hour in the value

DAYNAME(name_column with DATATYPE == DATETIME) FROM name_table
return the weekday , ex. TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, etc..

MONTH(name_column with DATATYPE == DATETIME) FROM name_table
return the number of month in the value

DATE_FORMAT(name_column, '%W' '%W %M %e, %Y') FROM name_table

LIMIT x,y;
    x represent how many records we want to skip.
    y represent how many records after x we like to get. 
    (regardless of that record's id)
    
BETWEEN operator can be use on VARCHAR type as well

specify a grouping function when using GROUP BY statement

An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value. Except for COUNT(*) , aggregate functions ignore null values. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. All aggregate functions are deterministic

aggregate function cannot be used in WHERE clause
