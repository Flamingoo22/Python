AJAX
    stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML
        Synchronous -- interpreter reads from top to bottom, line by line and doesnt move until the current line of code is finished.


To utilized Asynchronous
    We use the request-response cycle with a built in Javascript method called Fetch
        using promise or async/await


Let's use the Github API as an example:

Using Promises:

fetch("https://api.github.com/users/adion81")
    .then(response => response.json() )
    .then(coderData => console.log(coderData) )
    .catch(err => console.log(err) )

Using Async/Await:

async function getCoderData() {
    // The await keyword lets js know that it needs to wait until it gets a response back to continue.
    var response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/adion81");
    // We then need to convert the data into JSON format.
    var coderData = await response.json();
    return coderData;
}
    
console.log(getCoderData());
